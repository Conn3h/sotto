## Release: notarise the signed bundle and publish it as a GitHub release.
##
## `app` signs without a timestamp so offline builds work; notarisation requires a secure
## timestamp, so `notarize` re-signs the same bundle with one (same identity, so the
## Accessibility grant is unaffected), zips it with ditto (the only zip Gatekeeper accepts
## for bundles), submits it, staples the ticket into the bundle and zips again so the
## download carries the ticket offline. `spctl` runs the same assessment Gatekeeper does on
## first open, so a failure here is a failure the user would have seen.
