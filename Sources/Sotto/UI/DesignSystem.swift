///    never be used for a button, a link, a selection highlight, or any other kind of
///    emphasis.
/// 2. **`Color.meterLow` and `Color.meterHigh` are level-meter colours only.** The
///    restrained green-to-amber scale they form appears nowhere else in the chrome; using
///    either colour outside a level meter would make the meter's own coding ambiguous.
///
/// No gradients anywhere: every colour token below is a flat fill. Depth comes from
/// `Color.panel` / `Color.panelRaised` fills and `Color.hairline` borders, not shading.
